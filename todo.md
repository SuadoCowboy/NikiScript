- add comments: `//` and `/**/`
- Don't forget to include comment macros into var command to exclude them from var name

- add more context to Context: runningFrom, filePath, lineIndex, columnIndex, lineCount

- add Context::runningFrom variable right after making a good file exec function/struct/class
