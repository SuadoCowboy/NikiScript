- add `(a, b)` compatibility: `command(abc, def)` -> `command "abc" "def"`

- look for better name

- add comments: `//` and `/**/`

- use parameter type in parser(the type is the first char in the param name)
- explain somewhere each first char meaning in commands parameters names

- lua for plugin system?
